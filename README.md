My first Repository

Hi!
My name is Juris. 

I am learning JavaScript and looking forward to switch my career to WEVDEV soon. I want to create applications, some smaller projects at the beginning, to get familiar with development, and later participate in a bigger projects as a part of a great team.
My next steps are to finish up the JS course in Udemy (by Jonas Schmedtmann 60+hours), then I will dig deeper into HTML and CSS, and then learn Node.JS, and last step for now is React.(also all in Udemy).

I feel like I am more into UX, UI, and applications. Less web pages, but will see how it goes!

Have Fun!
