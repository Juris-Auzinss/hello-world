# hello-world
My first Repository

Hi!
My name is Juris, and I come from Latvia. 

I am learning JavaScript. I am looking to switch my career to WEVDEV soon and I think I want to create applications, some small projects at the begiining to get familiar with dev, and later participate in a bigger projects as a part of a great team.
My current and next steps are to finish up the JS course in Udemy (by Jonas Schmedtmann 60+hours), then I will dig deeper into HTML and CSS, and then learn Node.JS (also all in Udemy), and last step for now is React.

I feel like I am more into UX, UI, and more like application, then webpages. BUt will see..

Have Fun!
